# Prometheus Optimizer

## Overview
Prometheus Optimizer enhances Prometheus monitoring by optimizing configuration and rules management. It aims to improve performance and manageability for large-scale Prometheus deployments.Prometheus Optimizer actively analyzes Prometheus configurations, including recording rules, alert rules, and Grafana dashboards. It identifies metrics that are unused or redundant, generating a tailored Prometheus configuration to drop these metrics effectively. The tool automates the process of identifying inefficiencies in metric collection, allowing you to focus on truly valuable data, reducing storage and processing overhead.
## Features
- **Optimization**: Dynamically optimizes Prometheus based on usage and metrics.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale Prometheus installations.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster with Helm installed
- Prometheus setup within the cluster

### Installation
Clone the repository and deploy using Helm:
```bash
helm repo add prometheus-optimizer https://venomseven.github.io/prometheus-optimizer/ 
helm install prometheus-optimizer prometheus-optimize/prometheus-optimize
```
### Configuration
 Customize your deployments by modifying the values.yaml file to fit your specific monitoring requirements.

### Usage
The optimizer provides detailed reports on potential optimizations and the specific configurations needed to implement them, simplifying the process of enhancing your Prometheus setup.
